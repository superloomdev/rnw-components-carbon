# rnw-components-carbon

Carbon-informed component library for the RNW pipeline. Atoms, molecules, composites, and providers over the themer, with theme-driven responsiveness and a real accessibility contract.

## Overview

This module provides a themed component registry for React Native Web applications. It consumes a theme contract (`{ Color, Dimension, Font, Breakpoint }`) and produces a set of atoms, molecules, variants, and freeform components that all drive their visuals from tokens. The library ships no colour of its own: a theme supplies all 22 required `Color` tokens or
`createSystem` refuses to build, naming every absent one. That keeps the component set free
of any single design language - the same components render IBM Carbon or anything else,
depending entirely on the theme handed in.

`createSystem` is the only entry point: it builds the themed infrastructure without instantiating any component, and the caller registers the components it needs. A consumer using five components ships five factories, not all 245. Re-theming at runtime builds a new system; a system is never mutated in place.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @superloomdev/rnw-components-carbon
```

Peer dependencies: `react`, `react-native`, `helper-utils`, `helper-debug`, `helper-themer`, `helper-device`.

## Quick Start

```javascript
import {
  createSystem,
  themeContract,
  View, Text, Button
} from '@superloomdev/rnw-components-carbon';

// Bridge themer output to the theme contract
const theme = themeContract(themer.buildTheme(template, layers, 'native'));

// Build the system, then register only the components this screen uses
const system = createSystem({
  Utils: Utils,
  Debug: Debug,
  React: React,
  Device: Device,
  Icons: Icons
}, {}, theme, 'base');

system.addComponents({ View, Text, Button });

const Component = system.Component;
const Style = system.Style;

// Use components
const MyScreen = function () {
  return React.createElement(Component.View, { background: 'surface', p_a_lg: true },
    React.createElement(Component.Text, { size: 'xl', weight: 'bold' }, 'Hello'),
    React.createElement(Component.Button, {
      kind: 'primary',
      onPress: function () { /* ... */ }
    }, React.createElement(Component.Text, { color: 'text_on_primary' }, 'Submit'))
  );
};
```
